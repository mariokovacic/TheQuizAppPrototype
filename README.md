# TheQuizAppPrototype
#MyFirstQuizApp Ofcourse It could have been done better. (I'm still working on the skills, but I needed practice)I left more details in the README file.

// There is a lot of extra code which could have been written on a nicer way, advanced methods aswell and it could have been done in less time.(with time and practice.)
// Most importantly, IT WORKS. :) 
// In any case, it was a great practice and a big step for me. Looking forward to advancing those skills.

STAY AWESOME.
